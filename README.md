## 🧠 What is Scypheon?

Scypheon is an **on-device AI assistant** that operates entirely locally on your phone. No cloud. No data leaving your device. Just pure intelligence at your fingertips.

Like its namesake — the graceful jellyfish that navigates the ocean with neural networks of nerve fibers — Scypheon uses a neural mesh architecture to understand, assist, and protect.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **100% On-Device AI** — Runs locally using Qwen/DeepSeek/Llama models
- 🔒 **AES-256 Encrypted** — All data stored with SQLCipher encryption
- 🎯 **Agentic Execution** — AI can operate apps on your behalf (Puppet Master)
- 🌐 **Deep Research** — Multi-source research synthesis
- 📚 **Guided Learning** — Feynman-style explanations
- 🎨 **Liquid Glass UI** — Premium, Apple-inspired design

## ♿ Humanitarian Suite

Scypheon includes enterprise-grade accessibility features:

| Feature | For | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| 🧭 **Aether Navigator** | Blind/Low Vision | Spatial audio cues + haptic feedback |
| 👂 **Universal Ear** | Deaf/Hard of Hearing | Sound event detection (doorbell, alarms, baby crying) |
| 🎯 **Motor Assistant** | Motor Impairments | Head-tracking cursor + dwell-click |
| 💊 **Medicine Guard** | Elderly/Chronic Illness | Drug interaction checker + reminders |
| 👴 **Senior Mode** | Elderly | Simplified UI + emergency button |

## 🔐 Privacy

- All AI processing happens **on your device**
- Database encrypted with **SQLCipher (AES-256)**
- **No telemetry, no cloud, no tracking**
- You own your data. Period.
