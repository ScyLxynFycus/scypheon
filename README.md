## Mission

We believe AI should be accessible to everyone—regardless of ability, connectivity, or income.

Scypheon is built from the ground up to serve people who are often left behind by technology:

- **Blind & Low Vision** — AI-powered navigation and environment understanding
- **Deaf & Hard of Hearing** — Real-time sound awareness and captioning
- **Motor Impairments** — Hands-free device control
- **Elderly** — Simplified AI interaction with safety features
- **Low Connectivity Areas** — Works 100% offline, no internet required

## Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Privacy First** | All AI runs on-device. Your data never leaves your phone. |
| **Accessibility Native** | Not an afterthought—built into every feature. |
| **No Cloud Required** | Works offline. No subscription. No data harvesting. |
| **Open to All** | Designed for users in developing regions with limited connectivity. |

## What Scypheon Can Do

- **Agentic Automation** — AI that can operate apps on your behalf
- **Humanitarian Accessibility** — Enterprise-grade assistive technology
- **Intelligent Assistant** — On-device LLM for private conversations
- **Proactive Care** — Medication reminders, health monitoring, emergency alerts
